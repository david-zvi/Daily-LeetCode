Hi!

I've always liked problem solving, and wanted to get into coding questions more for coding interviews, so towards the end of May 2024 I started completing a leetcode question every day.

The solutions are divided into directories by the type of problem, are written in python 3 and each includes the link to it's leetcode question.

Enjoy :)
